File Used: train.csv

# Objective

Clean missing data

Explore relationships between variables

Identify patterns affecting survival

# Tools Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# Data Cleaning Steps

Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)

Converted categorical variables

Removed unnecessary columns

# EDA Performed

Survival rate by Gender

Survival rate by Passenger Class

Age distribution

Correlation analysis

# Key Insights

Females had higher survival rates than males

First-class passengers had better survival chances

Younger passengers showed slightly higher survival probability

# Conclusion

EDA helped identify important factors influencing survival, such as gender, class, and age.
